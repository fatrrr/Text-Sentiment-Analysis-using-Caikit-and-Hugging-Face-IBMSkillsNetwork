# Sentiment Analysis with Caikit and Hugging Face #
[Caikit](https://github.com/caikit/caikit) is an open source AI toolkit that enables users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. It provides a consistent format for creating and using AI models against a wide variety of data domains and tasks. Caikit streamlines the management of AI models for application usage which enables developers to write applications that consume AI models who may not understand the intricate details of the AI models that they use.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to load an open source AI model by using the Caikit runtime and then infer it from a client application by using the provided API. The example model is [Hugging Face DistilBERT base uncased finetuned SST-2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english), which analyzes text for sentiment.

Note: This project is based on the Caikit Tutorial: [Inferring an AI model from a client application with Caikit](https://caikit.github.io/website/docs/tutorial_appdev.html)
